      On energy laws and stability of Runge-Kutta methods for linear seminegative problems
    abstract: In scientific and engineering applications, people usually encounter time-dependent systems with a decaying total energy. A natural question to ask is that when using a time integration method to approximate such systems, whether and how the energy-decay law will be preserved at the discrete level. In this talk, we will focus on linear autonomous systems and present a general framework on deriving discrete energy identities for both explicit and implicit Runge-Kutta (RK) method. The established identities provide a precise characterization on energy generation or dissipation in the RK discretization, thereby leading to weak and strong stability criteria of RK methods. Furthermore, we also present a general energy identity for all the diagonal Pad√© approximations, based on an analytical Cholesky type decomposition of a class of symmetric matrices.

      Global existence of classical solutions of chemotaxis systems with logistic source and consumption or linear signal production on \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\)
    abstract: The current talk is concerned with the global existence of classical solutions for the following three primary chemotaxis systems with a logistic source on \(\mathbb{R}^n\),\[\begin{cases}u_t= \Delta u-\chi\nabla \cdot(u\nabla v)+u(a-bu),\quad x\in \mathbb{R}^n\cr\tau v_t= \Delta v-uv,\quad x\in\mathbb{R}^n,\end{cases}\tag{1}\label{abstract-eq1}\]\[\begin{cases}u_t= \Delta u-\chi\nabla \cdot(u\nabla v)+u(a-bu),\quad x\in \mathbb{R}^n\cr\tau v_t= \Delta v-\lambda v + \mu u,\quad x\in\mathbb{R}^n,\end{cases}\tag{2}\label{abstract-eq2}\]and\[\begin{cases}u_t= \Delta u-\chi\nabla \cdot(u\nabla v)+u(a-bu),\quad x\in \mathbb{R}^n\cr0= \Delta v-\lambda v + \mu u,\quad x\in\mathbb{R}^n,\end{cases}\tag{3}\label{abstract-eq3}\]where \(\chi\) is a nonzero number and \(a,b,\lambda,\mu, \tau\) are positive constants. We provide sufficient conditions for the global existence and boundedness of classical solutions of \(\eqref{abstract-eq1}\), \eqref{abstract-eq2}, and \eqref{abstract-eq3} with nonnegative initial functions in a unified way. It follows that nonnegative classical solutions of \eqref{abstract-eq1}, \eqref{abstract-eq2}, and \eqref{abstract-eq3} exist globally and stay bounded in one- and two-dimensional settings for any chemotaxis sensitivity \(\chi\). Moreover, we show that the methods developed for the study of \eqref{abstract-eq1}-\eqref{abstract-eq3} can be adapted to the bounded domain case without much effort. Several existing results for \eqref{abstract-eq1}, \eqref{abstract-eq2}, and \eqref{abstract-eq3} on bounded domains are then improved.

       Movement versus no movement: When is it good to move?
    abstract: In a famous paper published in 1998 on the evolution of slow dispersal, Dockery and his collaborators showed that,  when two identical diffusive competing species live together in the same ecological environment and are different in their dispersal rates,  the slower moving species will eventually drive  the faster species to extinction.  In a subsequent work in 2008, Cantrell and his collaborators then asked : would this competitive advantage still be preserved if one of these two species doesn't move?  This talk will focus on providing some satisfactory answer to this question.  In fact, our results   go beyond the simple setting of identical species. Furthermore, we will  also examine the dynamics of the classical solutions of a  consumer-resource system comprising a  non-dispersing single resource species whose density function evolves and is consumed by three competitors adopting three different dispersal mechanisms.   Our results reveal that the existence of a non-sink area is  beneficial to the non-dispersing species.
