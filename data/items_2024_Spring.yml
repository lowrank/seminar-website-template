   content: 'On energy laws and stability of Runge-Kutta methods for linear seminegative problems'
   abstract: In scientific and engineering applications, people usually encounter time-dependent systems with a decaying total energy. A natural question to ask is that when using a time integration method to approximate such systems, whether and how the energy-decay law will be preserved at the discrete level. In this talk, we will focus on linear autonomous systems and present a general framework on deriving discrete energy identities for both explicit and implicit Runge-Kutta (RK) method. The established identities provide a precise characterization on energy generation or dissipation in the RK discretization, thereby leading to weak and strong stability criteria of RK methods. Furthermore, we also present a general energy identity for all the diagonal Padé approximations, based on an analytical Cholesky type decomposition of a class of symmetric matrices.

   content: 'Global existence and asymptotic behavior of classical solutions of chemotaxis systems with logistic source and consumption on \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\)'
   abstract: The current talk is concerned with the global existence and asymptotic behavior of classical solutions of chemotaxis systems with logistic source and consumption on the whole space \(\mathbb{R}^n\). We will first consider the global existence of positive classical solutions. We then discuss the asymptotic behavior of solutions with strictly positive initials,  and the effect of chemotaxis on the rate of spread of the mobile species when the initial have compact support. This is a joint work with my advisors (Prof.Wenxian Shen) and (Dr.Yuming Paul Zhang).

   content: 'Movement versus no movement: When is it good to move?'
   abstract: In a famous paper published in 1998 on the evolution of slow dispersal, Dockery and his collaborators showed that,  when two identical diffusive competing species live together in the same ecological environment and are different in their dispersal rates,  the slower moving species will eventually drive  the faster species to extinction.  In a subsequent work in 2008, Cantrell and his collaborators then asked, would this competitive advantage still be preserved if one of these two species doesn't move?  This talk will focus on providing some satisfactory answer to this question.  In fact, our results   go beyond the simple setting of identical species. Furthermore, we will  also examine the dynamics of the classical solutions of a  consumer-resource system comprising a  non-dispersing single resource species whose density function evolves and is consumed by three competitors adopting three different dispersal mechanisms.   Our results reveal that the existence of a non-sink area is  beneficial to the non-dispersing species.

   content: 'A pseudo-reversible normalizing flow for stochastic differential equation and uncertainty quantification'
   abstract: We present a pseudo-reversible normalizing flow method for efficiently generating samples of the state of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with various initial distributions. Once trained,the normalizing flow model can directly generate samples of the SDE's final state without simulating trajectories. Notably, the model requires only a single training session, after which it can accommodate a range of initial distributions. This feature can provide a significant computational saving in studies of how the final state varies with the initial distribution. Additionally, we introduce a conditional pseudo-reversible normalizing flow for quantifying forward and inverse uncertainty propagation. The convergence analysis in the Kullback–Leibler divergence and numerical experiments will be provided.

   content: 'Space-time mixed finite element method for reduced fracture flow models on nonmatching grids'
   abstract: We propose a space-time mixed variational formulation of the flow problem in a fractured porous medium, where the fracture is treated as a lower dimensional object embedded in the rock matrix. Different spatial and temporal grids can be used in the subdomains and in the fracture to adapt to the heterogeneity of the problem. To efficiently solve the coupled system between the subdomains and the fracture, substructuring techniques are used to derive a space-time interface problem which is solved iteratively by GMRES. Analysis and numerical results for the proposed methods will be presented.
